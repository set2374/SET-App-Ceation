Hi Claude! I'm Stephen Turman, an attorney who built an AI-powered eDiscovery platform. I'd like your review of the architecture and implementation.

PROJECT: TLS eDiscovery Platform (NotebookLM-style interface)
REPOSITORY: https://github.com/set2374/SET-App-Ceation

START HERE:
https://github.com/set2374/SET-App-Ceation/blob/main/CLAUDE_AI_REVIEW.md

This document contains:
✓ Complete project overview
✓ Links to all key files and documentation
✓ Specific questions for you to assess
✓ Technology stack and architecture details
✓ Live demo link for testing

QUICK OVERVIEW:
- Built with Cloudflare Workers/Pages, D1 database, R2 storage
- PDF.js for text extraction + Tesseract.js OCR for scanned docs
- Anthropic Claude API integration for legal analysis
- Automatic Bates numbering, privilege detection, hallucination detection
- Full-text search across 1000s of pages

WHAT I NEED:
1. Architecture review (is Cloudflare edge stack appropriate?)
2. Security assessment (handling confidential legal documents)
3. Scalability concerns (will it handle 10,000+ documents?)
4. Code quality feedback
5. Performance optimization suggestions
6. Missing features for legal compliance

LIVE DEMO:

(You can upload PDFs, test OCR, search, and chat with AI)

Please read the review document and provide your comprehensive assessment. Thank you!
